14-3 - Highlighting Form Field with Missing or Incorrect Data
    Problem: You want to highlight missing or incorrectly entered information in a form field.
    Solution: For the fields that need to be validated, assign a function to the form field's onchange event handler that
        checks whether the field value is valid. If the value is invalid, pop up an alert with information about error,
        and highlight the field using a contrasting color.

        For the fields that need a required value, assign a function to the field's onblur event handler that checks
        whether a values has been entered.

        If any of the validation checks are performed as part of the form submittal, make sure to cancel the submittal
        event if the validation fails.
