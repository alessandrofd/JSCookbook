14.1 - Displaying a Hidden Page Section
    Problem: You want to hide or show a page section, as needed.

        when needed.

14.2 - Creating an Alert Message
    Problem: You want to alert the reader to important information.
    Solution: Create a visually distinctive alert message in the web page, and ensure it's noticed by AT devices.

14-3 - Highlighting Form Field with Missing or Incorrect Data
    Problem: You want to highlight missing or incorrectly entered information in a form field.
    Solution: For the fields that need to be validated, assign a function to the form field's onchange event handler that
        checks whether the field value is valid. If the value is invalid, pop up an alert with information about error,
        and highlight the field using a contrasting color.

        For the fields that need a required value, assign a function to the field's onblur event handler that checks
        whether a values has been entered.

        If any of the validation checks are performed as part of the form submittal, make sure to cancel the submittal
        event if the validation fails.
