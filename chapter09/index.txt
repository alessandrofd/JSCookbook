9-1. Accessing Form Text Input Values
    Problem: You need to access the contents of a text input form element using JavaScript.
    Solution: Use the DOM to access the form element:

            var formValue = document.forms["formName"].elements["elementName"].value;

9-2. Dynamically Disabling and Enabling Form Elements
    Problem: Based on some action or event, you want to disable, or enable, one or more form elements.
    Solution: Use the disabled property to enable or disable form element(s), accessing the element via the forms/elements
        collections:

            document.forms["formName"].elements["elementName"].disabled = true;

        or via direct access to an element via an identifier:

            document.getElementById("elementName").disabled = true;

9-3. Getting Information from a Form Element Based on an Event
    Problem: You need to access information from a form element after an event.
    Solution: Depending on the form element, you can capture any number of events, and based on the event, process the
        form element data.

9-4. Performing an Action when a Radio Button is Clicked
    Problem: You want to perform an action based on which radio button is clicked.
    Solution: Attach an onclick event handler to each of the radio buttons; in the event handler perform whatever action
        you need:

            window.onload = function() {
                var radios = document.forms[0].elements["group1"];
                for (var i = 0; i < radios.length; i++)
                    radios[i].onclick = radioClicked;
            }
            function radioClicked() {
                if (this.value = "one")
                    document.forms[0].elements["line_text"].disabled = true;
            }
